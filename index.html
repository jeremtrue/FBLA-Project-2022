Instructions:
To play: the user guesses a five letter word. <br>
The words will change a color.<br>
Gray if the letter is not in the word.<br>
Yellow if the word has the letter but it is in the wrong place.<br>
Green if the letter is right and in the right spot.<br>
When you type the keyboard letters also change that correspond with the letters in the Boxes.<br>
