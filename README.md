To play UltraWordle, you need to go to this website:
wordleunleashed.vercel.app

You would need Javascript to be active, aswell as cookies to be on.

First you guess a word that fits in the boxes.
Watch the boxed change colors.
The gray spots don't have the letter in the word.
The orange spots have the letter, but not in the correct place.
The green spots have the letter, and is in the right place.
Once you type a word, check to see if it has any green or orange.
If you have any orange, try to try a word with the specific letter in a different spot.
If you got any green, try a word with the letter in the spot.
Keep going until you got the word right, or ran out of guesses.

We used Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Our website is deployed by vercel.

Some Code was used to bring this website together off of
"https://www.freecodecamp.org/" and "https://www.w3schools.com/html/"

We used some code from both websites to put together this website as well as our own knowledge.
Toastr and jQuery were used for the notification like system.

Hope you enjoy!
